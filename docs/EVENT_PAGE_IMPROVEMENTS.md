# Event Details Page Improvements

## Overview
The event details page has been completely redesigned to match the site's theme and provide a better user experience with enhanced functionality.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Visual Design**
- **Hero Section**: Full-width hero image with gradient overlay and improved typography
- **Consistent Theme**: Uses the church theme colors (blue/green gradients) throughout
- **Modern Cards**: Rounded corners, proper shadows, and clean spacing
- **Colorful Icons**: Each detail section has its own colored icon background for better visual hierarchy
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes with proper mobile layouts

### 2. **Share Functionality** (Same as Blog Posts)
- **Social Sharing**: Facebook, Twitter/X, and Messenger sharing options
- **Copy Link**: Direct link copying with visual feedback
- **Popover Interface**: Clean popover menu for sharing options
- **Toast Notifications**: Success messages when actions are completed

### 3. **RSVP Functionality Explained**

#### What is RSVP?
RSVP stands for "Répondez s'il vous plaît" (French for "Please respond"). It's a way for attendees to register their intention to attend an event.

#### How it Works:
1. **Registration Modal**: Clicking "RSVP Now" opens a modal form where users can:
   - Enter their full name
   - Provide email address (required for confirmation)
   - Add phone number (optional)
   - Include a message or special requirements

2. **Capacity Management**:
   - Shows remaining spots available
   - Prevents registration when event is full
   - Displays current registration count
   - Visual indicators (green for available, red for full)

3. **Database Integration**:
   - RSVPs are stored in the `EventRSVP` table
   - Prevents duplicate registrations (unique by email per event)
   - Tracks registration timestamp

4. **User Experience**:
   - Real-time validation
   - Clear success/error messages
   - Email confirmation (ready for integration with email service)
   - Accessible form with proper labels and icons

### 4. **Improved Button Styling**
- **Back Button**: Glass morphism effect with hover animations
- **Share Button**: Outline style with hover color transitions
- **Like/Favorite Button**: Toggle state with fill animation
- **RSVP Button**: Prominent CTA with scale animation on hover
- **Disabled States**: Clear visual feedback when actions aren't available

### 5. **Enhanced Information Display**
- **Event Details Card**: 
  - Color-coded icons for each detail type
  - Clear hierarchy with labels and values
  - Attendance tracking with live count
  
- **About Section**:
  - Larger, more readable typography
  - Better prose styling for rich content
  - Proper dark mode support

### 6. **Additional Features**
- **Favorites System**: Users can like/favorite events (client-side for now)
- **Loading States**: Smooth animations and transitions
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and fallbacks
- **SEO Ready**: Structured data and proper meta tags support

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created:
1. **`EventDetailsClient`** - Main client component with all interactive features
2. **`EventRSVPModal`** - Reusable RSVP modal component
3. **API Route** - `/api/events/rsvp` for handling registrations

### Database Schema:
```prisma
model EventRSVP {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  eventId   String
  name      String
  email     String
  phone     String?
  message   String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  
  event Event @relation(fields: [eventId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  
  @@unique([eventId, email])
}
```

## Future Enhancements
1. **Email Integration**: Send confirmation emails to registered attendees
2. **Calendar Integration**: Add to calendar functionality
3. **QR Code**: Generate QR codes for event check-in
4. **Waitlist**: Allow waitlist registration when event is full
5. **Reminder System**: Send reminders before the event
6. **Analytics**: Track conversion rates and engagement

## Usage Instructions

### For Site Visitors:
1. Browse to any event detail page
2. Review event information
3. Click "RSVP Now" to register
4. Fill in the registration form
